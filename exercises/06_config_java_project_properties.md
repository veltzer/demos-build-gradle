Configure Java Build
====================

The purpose of this exercise is to configure how Gradle builds your java code.

* Start with a simple java project that builds.

* After build, can you spot the jar file that was created?

* Change the name of the jar file (no help, look it up).

* Add a version to the jar file (no help).

* Make the Jar file executable (hint: you need to add `Main-Class` to the jars manifest file).

* Change the location of the source files for the jar.
