Installing Gradle
=================

* The purpose of this exercise is to install gradle in 3 different ways.

After each installation note the version of gradle you got using
```bash
gradle -v
```

* First way: using the systems package manager

```shell
sudo apt install gradle
```

uninstall with:
```shell
sudo dpkg --purge gradle
```

* Second way: install sdkman and then install gradle with it

Do it on your own. No instructon (evil grin...)

* Third way: download a binary distribution of gradle

unzip it into some permanent folder

add it's `bin` subfolder into your path.

check that it works.
