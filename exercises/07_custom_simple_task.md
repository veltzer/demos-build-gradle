Simple Custom Task
==================

The purpose of this exercise is to create a simple task in Gradle.

The task will count the number of lines in a file.
The input file will be `list.txt` with the following content:

```text
1
2
3
```

The output file will be `count.txt` with the following content:
```text
3
```

you can write this in two different ways: pure groovy code, or derive from an Exec task.
